## 🧠 Project Objective

To explore and implement machine learning techniques (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Hybrid Models) to detect and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions in real time.

## 📊 Dataset

- 284,807 transactions
- Only 492 were fraudulent (class imbalance ~0.17%)
- Used anonymized Kaggle dataset

## 🛠️ Technologies Discussed

- Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)
- Kaggle Notebooks
- Random Forest, Logistic Regression
- ROC-AUC evaluation, Confusion Matrix

## 🧪 Model Accuracy

| Model              | ROC-AUC Score |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Random Forest      | 0.9436        |
| Logistic Regression| 0.9071        |
| Hybrid Model       | 0.9497        |
